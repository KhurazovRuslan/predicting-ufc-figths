This project is my attempt to build a machine learning model for predicting the results of UFC fights.
So far the project consists of:
- <a href='https://github.com/KhurazovRuslan/predicting-ufc-figths/blob/main/web%20scrap%20from%20ufcstats.com.ipynb'>Web scraping script</a> to gather data from <a href='http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed'>UFC statistics website</a> using python's beautifulsoup library
- <a href='https://github.com/KhurazovRuslan/predicting-ufc-figths/blob/main/events_data.csv'>events_data.csv file</a> that contains gathered data on every UFC event since 1994 (last updated on Dec 16,2020)
- <a href='https://github.com/KhurazovRuslan/predicting-ufc-figths/blob/main/fighters_data.csv'>fighters_data.csv file</a> that contains gathered data on every fighter (current and past) in UFC (last updated on Dec 16,2020)
- <a href='https://github.com/KhurazovRuslan/predicting-ufc-figths/blob/main/fights_data.csv'>fights_data.csv file</a> that contains gathered data on every UFC fight since 1994 (last updated on Dec 16,2020)
- <a href='https://github.com/KhurazovRuslan/predicting-ufc-figths/blob/main/EDA.ipynb'>EDA file</a> that contains simple exploritory analysis using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn


This will be updated as next steps of the project are ready
